# TypeScript MultiTool ðŸ› 

On the journey of building applications in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) you will need a menagerie of functions. Typically the user's trip down Google lane will bring you to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). The code is copied into the editor and the app construction continues. Bad, no chance the testing is added and now problems arise. The TypeScript MultiTool is a tree-shakable pile of functions helpful for building apps with all of the tests included in the library.

## Motivation

Building software accurately and quickly tends to yield a solution missing a lot of test coverage for quick and dirty functions usually plucked from google searches or [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com). This library is my own pile of functions I am using with the included test coverages to manage them.

## Installation

The recommended way to install is through `npm` or `Yarn`. The library is exposed as CommonJS and ESM.

npm:

```sh
npm install ts-multitool
```

yarn:

```sh
yarn add ts-multitool
```

## Usage

The entire point of `ts-multitool` is simplicity with the goal of producing rapid test-able solutions in TypeScript

# Functions

## Text Functions (available at `/text/`)

---

### `commaSeparatedString(string[],useOxfordComma)`

Take a list of strings and create a comma separated string. The `useOxfordComma` will place an [Oxford Comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma)

```typescript
import { commaSeparatedString } from 'ts-multitool'
const response = commaSeparatedString(['first', 'second', 'third'])
assert(response === 'first, second and third')
```

### `capitalize(string)`

Capitalizes the first letter of a string. It does NOT force lowercase on the remaining letters.

```typescript
import { capitalize } from 'ts-multitool'
const response = capitalize('thomas')
assert(response === 'Thomas')
```

---

## Array Functions (available at `/array/`)

---

### `unique<T>(T[])`

Returns a list of unique values from the given array (supports primitives)

```typescript
import { unique } from 'ts-multitool'
const list = unique([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 1])
// returns [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

---

## File Functions (available at `/files/`)

---

### `getExtension(string)`

Get the extension of a file.

```typescript
import { getExtension } from 'ts-multitool'
const ext = getExtension('somefile.that.you.need.jpg')
assert(response === 'jpg')
```

---

## Have something to add (or something is busted)?

Something to add to the library? Cool, add it and create a PR! If there is something busted in the library? Whoops, file an issue!

## Tests

Tests are executed via Jest.

```shell script
npm run test
```
