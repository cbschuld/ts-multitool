# TypeScript MultiTool ðŸ› 

In the journey of building applications in TypeScript you will need a menagerie of functions. Typically the user's trip down Google lane will bring you to StackOverflow. The code is copied into the editor and the app construction continues. Bad, no chance the testing is added and now problems arise. The TypeScript MultiTool is a tree-shakable pile of functions helpful for building apps with all of the tests included in the library.

## Motivation

Building software in accurately and quickly tends to yield a solution missing a lot of test coverage for quick and dirty functions typically plucked from the reality of finding them in google searches or on StackOverflow. This library is my own pile of functions I am using with the included test coverages to manage them.

## Installation

The recommended way to install the anticipated.io SDK is through `npm` or `Yarn`. The library is exposed as CommonJS and ESM.

npm:

```sh
npm install ts-multitool
```

yarn:

```sh
yarn add ts-multitool
```

## Usage

The entire point of `ts-multitool` is simplicity with the goal of producing rapid test-able solutions in TypeScript

# Functions

## Text Functions (available at `/text/`)

---

### `commaSeparatedString(string[],useOxfordComma)`

Take a list of strings and create a comma separated string. The `useOxfordComma` will place an [Oxford Comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma)

```typescript
import { commaSeparatedString } from 'ts-multitool/text/commaSeparatedString'
const response = commaSeparatedString(['first', 'second', 'third'])
assert(response === 'first, second and third')
```

## Have something to add (or something is busted)?

Something to add to the library? Cool, add it and create a PR! If there is something busted in the library? Whoops, file an issue!

## Tests

Tests are executed via Jest.

```shell script
npm run test
```
